# Pesato
Pesato is a Zomato/Swiggy Clone created using Java


## Technical notes

1. `Stage`: represents a Window
2. `Scene`: is something that is INSIDE the stage and can be swapped for another `scene` within a `stage` (a window).
3. `View`: Every Scene in turn is given a "View", like `MainView.java` (a `java.scene.view.Parent` object), which can be swapped for any other view
